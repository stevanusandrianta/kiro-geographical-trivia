# Project Structure

This workspace follows a clean, organized structure that will evolve based on the chosen technology stack.

## General Organization Principles
- Keep related files grouped together
- Separate source code from configuration files
- Use clear, descriptive folder and file names
- Maintain consistent naming conventions

## Common Directory Patterns
Depending on the project type, typical structure includes:
- `src/` - Main source code
- `tests/` or `__tests__/` - Test files
- `docs/` - Documentation
- `config/` - Configuration files
- `scripts/` - Build and utility scripts
- `assets/` or `static/` - Static resources

## File Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with hyphens for directories (kebab-case)
- Follow language-specific conventions for file names
- Use descriptive names that indicate file purpose
- Group related functionality in modules/packages

## Configuration Files
- Keep configuration files at the root level
- Use standard names for common files (README.md, .gitignore, etc.)
- Document any custom configuration in README
